# Bamboo v1.0 Upgrade Guide (Stub)

> **Status:** Placeholder. Flesh out concrete upgrade paths, compatibility notes, and migration checklists before publishing the v1.0 announcement.

2. _TODO: Document dependency updates (Composer, PHP extensions, system packages)._ 
3. _TODO: Provide guidance for migrating CLI usage and automation scripts._
4. _TODO: Capture router, middleware, and module changes that require code updates._
5. _TODO: Include verification steps (tests, smoke checks, health endpoints)._ 

## Compatibility matrix
