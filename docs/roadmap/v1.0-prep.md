# Bamboo v1.0 API Freeze Preparation

This planning note captures the contract surfaces that must be frozen ahead of
the v1.0 milestone and the supporting documentation deliverables that keep the
community aligned. Each section highlights the review checkpoints required
before cutting the release candidate so breaking changes are surfaced early and
compatibility guarantees are explicit.

## Public API surfaces slated for freeze

### CLI command palette

Bamboo's dot-notation CLI is the operational front door for most users. The
freeze ensures command names, required arguments, and structured output remain
stable across the 1.x line.

- [x] Review the complete command roster (`bin/bamboo list`) and document
      stability levels for each entry (stable, experimental, or internal).
- [x] Capture input/output contracts for critical commands (`http.serve`,
      `routes.cache`, `queue.work`, `dev.watch`, etc.) in `docs/cli/` reference
      pages before the freeze.
- [x] Establish guardrails for future additions: new commands require semver
      minor releases, and renames must ship with deprecated aliases for at least
      one minor release.
- [x] Publish a CLI deprecation policy in the upgrade guide describing how long
      aliases are maintained and how operators are notified (release notes +
      runtime warnings).

### HTTP router contract

Routes define the public HTTP surface for applications built on Bamboo. Freezing
method matching, parameter binding, and error behaviour gives downstream teams
confidence that v1.x upgrades will not break HTTP integrations.

- [x] Enumerate supported HTTP methods, route declaration helpers, and parameter
      token formats in `docs/router.md` with code examples.
- [x] Validate that 404/405/500 response payloads and status codes are covered by
      contract tests and describe them in the API docs.
- [x] Document middleware ordering guarantees (global → group → route) and
      ensure the behaviour is regression-tested in `tests/Router/` suites.
- [x] Define the router deprecation story: route helper removals must emit
      `E_USER_DEPRECATED` notices and remain available through at least v1.(x+1).

### Module extension API

Modules implement `Bamboo\Module\ModuleInterface` to extend the framework.
Freezing this contract stabilises how third-party packages integrate with the
core container and middleware system.

- [ ] Audit the module lifecycle (`register`, `boot`, `middleware`) and confirm
      no additional hooks are required for the v1.0 baseline.
- [ ] Document module discovery and configuration expectations in
      `docs/modules.md`, including examples for publishing middleware aliases and
      services.
- [ ] Define semantic-versioning rules for modules: breaking interface changes
      require a major release, and optional method additions must provide sane
      defaults.
- [ ] Outline the module deprecation policy: interface removals follow a two-step
      cycle (deprecated in v1.x, removed no earlier than v2.0) with CHANGELOG and
      runtime notices.

### Configuration schema

Configuration files under `etc/` are treated as part of the public contract for
self-hosted deployments. The freeze covers file names, array shapes, and default
keys used by the bootstrap sequence.

- [ ] Produce a schema index in `docs/configuration/overview.md` summarising
      every `etc/*.php` file, expected keys, and types.
- [ ] Add validation hooks (via `composer validate:config` script) to detect
      missing or malformed keys before runtime.
- [ ] Forbid silent renames: configuration key migrations must ship shims that
      read both the old and new keys for one minor release.
- [ ] Write the configuration deprecation policy into the upgrade guide,
      including examples for feature-flagged fallbacks and migration helpers.

## Documentation deliverables for v1.0

### Upgrade guide (`docs/upgrade/v1.0.md`)

- [ ] Draft step-by-step upgrade instructions covering configuration changes,
      CLI contract updates, and deprecations lifted for v1.0.
- [ ] Include a compatibility matrix showing which OpenSwoole and PHP versions
      are officially supported.
- [ ] Integrate with the existing static site generator plan (MkDocs) so the
      guide renders alongside other `docs/` content and is published on release
      day.

### Performance benchmarks (`docs/benchmarks/`)

- [ ] Capture baseline HTTP throughput/latency numbers using the maintained
      `bin/bench/http` harness and document the environment configuration.
- [ ] Store raw benchmark results (CSV/JSON) under `docs/benchmarks/data/` for
      reproducibility and graph generation.
- [ ] Add instructions for regenerating charts using the `docs/tools/plot-bench`
      script (Python + matplotlib) and ensure MkDocs can embed the generated
      images.

### Starter blueprints (`docs/starters/` + `README.md` overview)

- [ ] Publish opinionated starter templates (REST API, queue worker, WebSocket
      gateway) with `composer create-project` snippets in `docs/starters/`.
- [ ] Reference each blueprint from the main `README.md` so newcomers can pick a
      starting point without browsing the full docs site.
- [ ] Provide tooling notes for the static site: enable MkDocs collections to
      surface starter cards and wire Netlify (or GitHub Pages) deployment so
      updates go live automatically.

## Release readiness tracking

- [ ] Cross-link this document from `README.md` under the roadmap section so the
      community can track progress.
- [ ] Review the checklist weekly in milestone syncs and mark completed items to
      signal stability.
- [ ] Once all freeze tasks are complete, announce the transition to release
      candidate status on the project discussion board and lock further breaking
      changes until v2.0 planning begins.
