# v1.0 Release Task Stubs

These task stubs capture the remaining work required to close out the unchecked
items in [`docs/roadmap/v1.0-prep.md`](../roadmap/v1.0-prep.md). Each stub
includes background context, deliverables, and suggested next steps so they can
be promoted to full issues or assigned to an owner without re-triaging the
roadmap.

## Open stubs

- [Integrate the configuration validator with CI](config-validation-ci.md)
- [Document the configuration deprecation policy](upgrade-guide-config-deprecations.md)
- [Publish the inaugural benchmark dataset](benchmarks-baseline-dataset.md)
