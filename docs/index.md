# Bamboo Documentation

Welcome to the official Bamboo documentation hub. This site collects the
installation guides, framework reference material, task automation playbooks,
and roadmaps that keep the Bamboo microframework and its starter templates
aligned.

Use the navigation to explore:

- **Installation** walkthroughs for supported PHP runtimes and OpenSwoole.
- The **Framework Guide** covering routing, module lifecycles, and
  configuration schemas.
- **CLI** command references and JWT tooling notes for day-to-day operations.
- Operational **Tasks** such as configuration validation, benchmarking, and
  handling deprecations during upgrades.
- **Starters** and **Benchmarks** documentation for project templates and
  performance tooling.
- The long-term **Roadmap** and **Upgrade** guides that describe upcoming work
  and how to adopt new Bamboo releases.

If you maintain custom starters or deployment tooling, remember to update the
navigation (`mkdocs.yml`) when new documents are added so MkDocs can surface
them in the published site.
